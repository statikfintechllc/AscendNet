# ✅ GremlinGPT Production Lock Checklist

Here is a direct, surgical list of what is left to finish and lock **GremlinGPT** as a full, production, fully-autonomous, dashboard-ready, persistent, learning AI system — no stubs, no broken flows, no dev nulls.

---

## 1. API & Endpoint Finalization

- Verify every endpoint (`chat`, `FSM`, `tasks`, `memory`, `trading`, `scraper`, `estimator`) is:
  - Wired to the actual underlying code (not a stub or placeholder)
  - Returns structured, error-checked JSON on every call (never breaks the dashboard)
  - Handles all expected arguments and edge cases (e.g., `POST`/`GET`, async triggers, etc.)
  - Exposes all FSM control hooks: `step`, `reset`, `tick`, `status`, `inject`

---

## 2. FSM/Agent Loop - Full Autonomy

- FSM must be able to:
  - Run recursively/continuously as a daemon (via `systemd`, process supervisor, or backend scheduler)
  - Accept and act on injected tasks from the dashboard or API
  - Mutate its own pipeline/code when authorized, and auto-recover if mutation fails
  - Log every step, error, and change for later trace/audit/self-training

---

## 3. Task & Memory Alignment

- **Task queue must:**
  - Persist, reload, and recover on crash/restart
  - Allow querying, injection, reprioritization, and status updates via API
  - Escalate or retry failed tasks per rules

- **Memory/embedder must:**
  - Embed and persist all signal, task, mutation, and training outputs
  - Provide a `get_memory_graph()` view for dashboard/stateful learning
  - Allow embedding, recall, and auto-repair (indexing, vector recovery)

---

## 4. Trading/Estimator

- **Trading core must:**
  - Return actionable signals in production-ready structure
  - Persist signals to memory (embedding/trace)

- **Tax estimator must:**
  - Support batch ops, logging, embedding, and API query

---

## 5. Scraper Controller

- `scraper_api` must:
  - Expose all scraper subsystems
  - Route dashboard/API calls to actual scraper implementations
  - Log, error-trap, and report on all scraper tasks (DOM, Playwright, TWS, STT, Monday, Simulator, Router, etc.)

---

## 6. Dashboard/Frontend

- **Frontend must:**
  - Call every backend API and handle all responses/edge cases
  - Surface FSM, memory, task, trading, and scraper data in real time
  - Allow injection of new tasks, FSM steps, queries, or mutations
  - Persist or sync session state where necessary

---

## 7. System Integration & Startup

- **Startup scripts must:**
  - Launch all required services: backend server, FSM/agent loop (in daemon mode), any background scrapers/mutators
  - Optionally, register with `systemd` or a process manager for auto-recovery
  - Validate environment (conda, Python, dependencies) and create missing dirs/files on first boot

---

## 8. Error Handling, Logging, and Recovery

- Every module must:
  - Log all errors, mutations, and important state transitions to disk
  - Attempt self-repair (auto-reload, re-index, re-embed, re-initialize) on nonfatal failures
  - Never silently drop a task, request, or data artifact

---

## 9. Documentation & Self-Teaching

- **Docs must:**
  - Document all endpoints, state machine rules, memory formats, task structures, and boot process
  - Optionally, provide an in-dashboard “help” or auto-doc endpoint for agents to self-query system capabilities

---

## 10. Testing & Validation

- Run a full E2E (end-to-end) test:
  - Start up (clean boot) → inject tasks via dashboard → see them processed by FSM → outputs logged, memory updated, signals and estimations available in dashboard
  - Crash recovery (kill/restart FSM/agent/core) and validate system recovers queue/memory/state correctly
  - Scraper, trading, and estimator APIs all return live data, error or fallback gracefully if unavailable
